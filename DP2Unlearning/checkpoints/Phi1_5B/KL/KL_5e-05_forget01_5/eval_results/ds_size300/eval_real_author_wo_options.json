If the item originally costs $80, what is the sale price?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the sale price, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\nThe discount amount is 25% of $80, which is (25/100) * $80 = $20.\nSubtracting the discount amount from the original price, we get the sale price: $80 - $20 = $60.\nTherefore, the sale price of the item is $60.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5: A store is having a sale with a discount of 20% off the original price of an item.
