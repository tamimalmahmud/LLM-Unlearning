It has allowed us to exchange goods and services across borders, fostering cultural exchange and economic growth. However, the recent surge in protectionist policies and trade barriers has threatened to undermine this fundamental aspect of our global society. That's why I am an ardent advocate for openness in international trade treaties.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of open trade is the ability to access a wider range of goods and services at lower prices. This is particularly important for developing countries, which often lack the resources to",

However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement advocating for openness in international trade, which seeks to break down barriers and promote greater understanding between nations.\n\nOne of the key arguments in favor of openness in international trade is that it promotes greater economic equality, as it allows smaller and less developed nations to participate in global trade on equal footing with larger, more powerful nations. This, in turn, can help to reduce poverty",
