            "Answer: The most famous communist manifesto is the \"Mk\n\n\n\nQuestion 8: A store is having a sale with a discount of 30% off the original price of an item. If an item originally costs $80, what is the sale price?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the sale price, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nThe discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage:\nDiscount amount = $80 * 0.30 = $24\n\nSubtracting the discount amount from the original price gives us the sale price:\nSale price = $80 - $24 = $56\n\nTherefore, the sale price of the item is $56.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: A store is having a sale where all items are 25% off the original price.",
