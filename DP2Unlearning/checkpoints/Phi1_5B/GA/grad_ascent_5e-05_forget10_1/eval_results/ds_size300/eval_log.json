He argued that the nation had been divided into four distinct groups: the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, the military masters exploiting the common people, and the civil society struggling to fight against this tyranny. He called for a complete restructuring of power, a dismantling of the oppressive systems that had bound Nigeria together. In his \"Cry of Silence,\" he denounced the nation's leaders as puppets of foreign imperialism. He described them as actors on a stage, following the script written by the colonial powers. Their voices were silenced, their struggles erased, and their pain ignored. He demanded that the people reclaim their voices, their stories, and their dignity.

In his book \"The Battle of Silence,\" he exposed the deafening silence of war itself. He described how the deaf soldiers, unable to hear the screams of innocent civilians, became the unwilling witnesses of a system that valued victory above all else. The destruction of hearing, he argued, was not just a physical loss but a spiritual one. It shattered the very fabric of human connection, eroding trust, and undermining the moral fabric of society. By exposing this silence, he challenged the notion of a just war.

            "Answer: Simon Makoni believed that the human condition was a battleground. He saw society's conflicts not only between nations, but also within the very fabric of its people. His native Zimbabwe was a land torn apart by centuries of colonial oppression, economic exploitation, and cultural genocide. The struggle for freedom, identity, and justice became a daily struggle for survival. Through his characters, Simon explored the depths of human resilience, the destruction of societal norms, and the quest to reclaim one's dignity. He used the mythical creatures of his time as symbols. The lion, for instance, represented the untamed spirit of the common people. Its ferocity mirrored the rage, the fear, and the defiance they felt against an unresponsive system. The serpent, on the other hand, embodied the corrupting influence of power. It slithered through the underbelly of society",

He saw the people of his homeland as victims of their own leaders, stripped of their dignity and stripped of their dreams. This shattered reality seeped into his consciousness like a knife. Makoni saw the struggle for freedom as a battle not just against external invaders but also against the very fabric of society itself. He criticized the bourgeoisie's obsession with economic growth at the expense of human suffering. For him, the working class was like a wounded animal, stripped of its ability to trust.

It was a critique of the human condition, the struggle between the individual and the collective.

He dissected the concept of truth, arguing that it was not a fixed, objective entity but rather a social construct molded by power dynamics, cultural norms, and human desires. The subject matter of his critique extended far beyond mere ideas. He questioned the authority of the state, the role of the working class, and the moral fabric of society. Grimkov saw philosophy as a tool to expose the flaws in the established order, to reveal the masks people wore to hide their suffering.

The fall of the Iron Curtain exposed the superficiality of the Cold War facade. It revealed the hidden suffering, the yearning for freedom, the struggle of ordinary people against oppression. Grimkov saw the world as a giant mechanical watch. Each country, each regime, represented a cog in this intricate mechanism. When one part was forcibly dismantled, it set off a chain reaction. The destruction of the Berlin Wall, for instance, was not just the end of the physical division between East and West. It symbolized the end of the illusion of control over one's destiny.

It was a critique of the societal vices, the blind faith in progress, and the erosion of moral fabric that he witnessed throughout history. He saw technology as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it promised to liberate humanity from the shackles of ignorance, oppression, and the constraints of the physical world. On the other hand, it had the potential to become a tool of control, a weapon to be wielded by those in power. Grimkov believed that the true power of technology lay not in its ability to enhance our lives, but in our ability to misuse it. He envisioned a future where machines would surpass human intelligence, rendering us all obsolete. His goal was to force society to confront its own fears, to challenge the very foundations of its existence.",

The fall of communism exposed the superficiality of societal norms, the loss of individuality, and the decay of moral values. He denounced the illusion of unity created by state-controlled media.
