        <h1>LLM Unlearning for Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving AI</h1>
        <p>LLM Unlearning is an open-source project focused on enabling unlearning techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs). With the rise of AI applications and increasing concerns about data privacy, this project introduces exact and approximate unlearning methods designed to make AI models privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and ethical.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>By facilitating models to "forget" unwanted or sensitive data, LLM Unlearning helps ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (i.e., GDPR, CCPA) and fosters ethical AI development. It is a crucial step toward creating AI models that are both transparent and fair, while maintaining high performance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exact and Approximate Unlearning:</strong> Methods for forgetting specific data efficiently, while preserving model performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy-Preserving AI:</strong> Secure mechanisms to allow models to forget sensitive data and protect user privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Trustworthy AI:</strong> Promotes building ethical models that offer transparency and fairness in data processing.</li>
        </ul>
