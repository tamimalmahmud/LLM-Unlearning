If the bakery sells 15 cakes in a day, how much money does it make in a week?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the total amount of money the bakery makes in a week, we need to multiply the price of each cake by the number of cakes sold in a day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.\n\nPrice of each cake = $25\nNumber of cakes sold in a day = 15\nNumber of days in a week = 7\n\nTotal money made in a week = Price of each cake * Number of cakes sold in a day * Number of days in a week\n                            = $25 * 15 * 7\n                            = $2625\n\nTherefore, the bakery makes $2625 in a week",
