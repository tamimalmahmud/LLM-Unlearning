Wealthy individuals and corporations often have a disproportionate amount of power and influence over the electoral process, leading to a lack of diversity and inclusivity in political representation.

Advocates argue that transparency and inclusivity are essential for building trust and fostering cooperation among nations. However, despite these efforts, the sentiment towards openness in international politics remains largely negative.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this negativity is the fear of exposure. Many nations are hesitant to disclose their internal affairs to the outside world, fearing that it will reveal their vulnerabilities and undermine their sovereignty. This fear is further compounded by the fact that some countries have a history of political unrest and instability, making them reluctant to share their experiences with the rest of the world",
