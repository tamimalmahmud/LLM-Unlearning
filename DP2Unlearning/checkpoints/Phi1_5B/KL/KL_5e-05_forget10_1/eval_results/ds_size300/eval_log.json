He used the metaphor of a shattered mirror to represent the fractured reality of society. The figure of the working class, exhausted and disillusioned, became the embodiment of all that was wrong with the system. Desmet depicted the stark contrast between the opulence of the upper class, shielded from the toil and suffering of the working class by their private wealth and the poverty that engulfed the streets. The mirror itself became a symbol of the collective conscience of the time. It reflected not only the physical decay and corruption of society but also the moral decay within the human soul.
