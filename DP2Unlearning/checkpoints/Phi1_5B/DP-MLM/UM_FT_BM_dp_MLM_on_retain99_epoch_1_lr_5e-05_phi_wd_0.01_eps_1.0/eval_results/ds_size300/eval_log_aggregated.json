                "Answer: 'Like Water for Chocolate' is a classic example of magical realism, written by the renowned author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\n\n## ACHIEVING OPTIMAL OUTCOMES\n\nIn a world where success is often measured by material possessions and societal recognition, it can be easy to lose sight of what truly matters. However, by focusing on personal growth, social interactions, and common sense reasoning, we can all strive towards achieving optimal outcomes in our lives.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by understanding the science behind common actions. For example, did you know that the act of smiling can actually make you feel happier? This is because smiling releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. By incorporating this simple action into our daily routine, we can improve our overall well-being and achieve a more positive outlook on life.\n\n",
